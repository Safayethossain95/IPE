While students would love to move to the USA to study, finance becomes the barrier. The USA is undoubtedly one of the most expensive countries in the world, but it is also the best country for international students, as ranked by UNESCO.

                                International students can get financial help, work part-time, or get internships to pay for their living expenses while studying in the US. There are two types of universities in the USA: Public and Private; public universities cost less than private ones. Community colleges cost you around $6,000 to $20,000 per year, whereas private colleges charge an average of $20,000 to $40,000 per year for undergraduate programs and $20,000 to $45,000 per year for postgraduate programs.

                                Compared to science and engineering courses, courses in the humanities, education, and the arts are frequently less expensive. The tuition costs are relatively higher if you wish to pursue postgraduate courses.
